# Model Selection Guide

## The 80/20 Rule
- 80% of tasks: Default models work fine
- 15% of tasks: Need "pro" versions
- 5% of tasks: Need specialized solutions

## Decision Tree

### Start Here: What's Your Primary Constraint?

#### If QUALITY is paramount:
- Use: GPT-4, Claude Opus, Gemini Ultra
- When: Final deliverables, complex reasoning, creative work
- Trade-off: Higher cost, slower response

#### If SPEED is critical:
- Use: GPT-3.5, Claude Haiku, Gemini Pro
- When: Real-time applications, high volume
- Trade-off: Lower quality, less nuance

#### If COST is the concern:
- Use: Open source (Llama, Mistral), API with caching
- When: High volume, predictable tasks
- Trade-off: More setup, potential quality variance

#### If PRIVACY is required:
- Use: Local models, enterprise agreements
- When: Sensitive data, regulatory requirements
- Trade-off: Higher complexity, resource needs
