# The Five Human Questions Framework

Every AI implementation must answer these questions:

## 1. "Who is left out?" (Inclusion)
- Accessibility considerations
- Language barriers
- Technical literacy requirements
- Economic barriers
- Geographic limitations

### Checklist:
- [ ] Can users with disabilities access this?
- [ ] Is this available in multiple languages?
- [ ] What's the minimum tech requirement?
- [ ] What's the cost barrier?
- [ ] Does this work on low bandwidth?

## 2. "Who decides?" (Agency)
- Human override capabilities
- Decision transparency
- Control mechanisms
- Opt-out options

### Checklist:
- [ ] Can humans override AI decisions?
- [ ] Is it clear when AI is making decisions?
- [ ] Can users adjust AI behavior?
- [ ] Is there a non-AI alternative?

## 3. "What happens when it fails?" (Trust)
- Error handling
- Fallback mechanisms
- Recovery paths
- Support systems

### Checklist:
- [ ] Is there a graceful failure mode?
- [ ] Can users report problems easily?
- [ ] Is there human support available?
- [ ] Are failure impacts documented?

## 4. "Can I explain this?" (Transparency)
- Decision explainability
- Process visibility
- Audit trails
- Documentation

### Checklist:
- [ ] Can you explain why AI gave this output?
- [ ] Is the process documented?
- [ ] Can decisions be audited?
- [ ] Do users understand what's happening?

## 5. "Will anyone actually use this?" (Adoption)
- Real problem solving
- Workflow integration
- Change management
- Value demonstration

### Checklist:
- [ ] Does this solve a verified problem?
- [ ] Does it fit existing workflows?
- [ ] Is the value clear in 30 seconds?
- [ ] Would you use this yourself?
