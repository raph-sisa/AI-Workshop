# AI-Workshop

## Workshop Philosophy
We teach fundamentals and agency, not just tools. This workshop helps participants learn to evaluate, choose, and adapt ANY AI tool rather than memorizing specific platforms.

## Core Principles
- 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 **Human-Centered**: AI augments human capability, never replaces human judgment
- 🎯 **Fundamentals Over Features**: Learn principles, not temporary tool knowledge
- 🔄 **Learning by Doing**: Hands-on experimentation with real feedback
- 🛡️ **Psychological Safety**: Better done than perfect
- ⚡ **Agency & Control**: Humans stay in charge
