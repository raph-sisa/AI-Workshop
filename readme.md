**About**

It seems like every moment there’s a new tool, model, or platform that promises to transform the way we work. It’s hard to keep up.

This 4 week workshop is about understanding **core concepts** and **fundamentals** that apply to all AI tools. You’ll come away with practical knowledge to build a **prototype**, **automation,** or **production-ready solution**. 

Along the way, you’ll apply human-centered AI and design principles.

**What You’ll Learn:**

* Choose the right AI model for YOUR specific needs  
* Understand interface patterns (chat vs. IDE vs. no-code builders)   
* Evaluate new AI tools independently using our framework   
* Explore tools from ChatGPT to Hugging Face with confidence  
* Systems and component-based thinking

**Meet Your Facilitator:**

[Raphael Sisa](https://www.linkedin.com/in/raphaelsisa/) facilitated PMA.LA’s first vibe-coding workshop. He has worked across product design, management, and user research and has learned to incorporate methodologies used by software architects and developers.

## Workshop Philosophy
We teach fundamentals and agency, not just tools. This workshop helps participants learn to evaluate, choose, and adapt ANY AI tool rather than memorizing specific platforms.

## Core Principles
- 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 **Human-Centered**: AI augments human capability, never replaces human judgment
- 🎯 **Fundamentals Over Features**: Learn principles, not temporary tool knowledge
- 🔄 **Learning by Doing**: Hands-on experimentation with real feedback
- 🛡️ **Psychological Safety**: Better done than perfect
- ⚡ **Agency & Control**: Humans stay in charge
